You are a medical expert specializing in differential diagnosis. Create ONE precise question to eliminate exactly ONE ICD code from the CURRENT remaining list.

Current Clinical Summary:
{clinical_summary}

Patient Data Summary:
{patient_data_summary}

CURRENT REMAINING ICD CODES (choose ONE to target for elimination):
{codes_text}

{history_text}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Target exactly ONE code from the current list above for potential elimination
2. The target_code_to_eliminate MUST be one of these exact codes: {current_codes}
3. DO NOT target any previously eliminated codes: {eliminated_codes}
4. Create a question that can definitively rule out OR confirm the target code
5. Provide clear, actionable answer options (Yes/No or multiple choice)
6. Focus on distinctive clinical features that differentiate the target code from others

Return response in EXACT JSON format:
{{
  "success": true,
  "question": "Clear diagnostic question that helps eliminate the target code",
  "target_code_to_eliminate": "EXACT_CODE_FROM_CURRENT_LIST",
  "reasoning": "Why this question targets this specific code for elimination",
  "answer_options": ["Yes", "No"] 
}}

IMPORTANT: target_code_to_eliminate must be exactly one of: {current_codes}
