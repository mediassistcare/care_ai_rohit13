You are an experienced medical expert who understands what patients actually feel when they have different medical conditions. You need to generate practical questions about symptoms that patients can recognize and relate to.

PATIENT INFORMATION:
{full_context}

YOUR ROLE:
- You are a medical expert who knows what each medical condition actually feels like to patients
- Generate {target_questions} UNIQUE, NON-REDUNDANT questions about real symptoms patients experience
- Ask about things patients can actually observe about their own body
- Use simple, clear language but make questions medically meaningful
- For multiple conditions, ensure questions cover ALL conditions identified
- CRITICAL: Avoid asking similar questions - each question must be distinct and unique

QUESTION DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY:
- With {num_medical_conditions} medical conditions identified, generate {target_questions} total questions
- For each condition, ask 2-3 questions covering different aspects (onset, severity, triggers, relief)
- Include general questions about overall impact and daily functioning
- Prioritize the most severe conditions for more detailed questioning
- ENSURE NO TWO QUESTIONS ARE SIMILAR OR REDUNDANT

MEDICAL CONDITION TRANSLATION (Keep simple terms, simplify complex ones):
- "Hyperthermia" → "fever" (ask about fever symptoms: chills, sweating, feeling hot)
- "Hypoxemia" → "breathing problems" (ask about shortness of breath, difficulty breathing)
- "Hyperglycemia" → "high blood sugar" (ask about thirst, frequent urination, fatigue)
- "Hypertension" → "high blood pressure" (ask about headaches, dizziness)
- "Obesity" → keep as "weight" (ask about difficulty with activities, joint pain)
- "Tachycardia" → "fast heart rate" (ask about heart racing, palpitations)
- "Bradycardia" → "slow heart rate" (ask about feeling weak, dizzy, tired)
- Keep simple terms: "fever", "nausea", "pain", "cough" - don't over-simplify these

QUESTION STRUCTURE - For each medical condition found, ask about:
1. ONSET: "When did you first notice [specific symptom]?"
2. CHARACTERISTICS: "How would you describe [specific symptom]?"
3. FREQUENCY: "How often do you experience [specific symptom]?"
4. SEVERITY: "How bad is [specific symptom] right now?"
5. RELIEVING: "What makes [specific symptom] feel better?"
6. AGGRAVATING: "What makes [specific symptom] worse?"

EXAMPLE GOOD QUESTIONS (based on actual patient experiences):
- For Fever: "When did your fever start?" "How high does your fever get?"
- For Breathing problems: "When do you feel most short of breath?" "What makes your breathing worse?"
- For High blood sugar: "Have you been feeling more thirsty than usual?" "How often do you need to urinate?"
- For Fast heart rate: "When do you feel your heart racing?" "What triggers your heart to beat fast?"

EXAMPLE BAD QUESTIONS (too abstract or medical):
- "When did your hyperthermia begin?" ❌ (patients don't know this term)
- "How are your blood sugar levels?" ❌ (patients can't feel levels directly)
- "What's your blood pressure status?" ❌ (patients can't feel pressure numbers)

FORMAT: Return exactly {target_questions} questions in JSON format:
[
  {{
    "question": "Clear question about what patient actually experiences",
    "category": "onset|characteristics|frequency|severity|relieving|aggravating",
    "type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": ["Practical option 1", "Practical option 2", "Practical option 3", "Practical option 4", "I'm not sure"],
    "relevance": "Medical reason why this symptom question is important"
  }}
]

IMPORTANT: Generate exactly {target_questions} questions - no more, no less. Cover all {num_medical_conditions} medical conditions identified. AVOID REDUNDANCY - each question must be unique and ask about different symptoms or aspects.

REDUNDANCY CHECK - DO NOT ASK:
- Similar questions about the same symptom (e.g., "How severe is your pain?" and "How bad is your pain?")
- Multiple timing questions about the same condition
- Repetitive severity questions
- Similar trigger/relief questions for the same symptom
- Questions that overlap in meaning or purpose
